NewsFeedAppTemplate
=======

I created this project initially for a pet-video sharing app I was contracted out for. The contract fell through but a lot of the initial work I had done can be recycled for almost any mobile app project. This project includes a side-bar controller, Parse user and Cloud Code integration, Facebook and Twitter SDK integration, and some basic newsfeed and graphic visualizations.
